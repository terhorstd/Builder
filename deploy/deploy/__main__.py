Organize a set of builds.

Usage: deploy [options] shell <config>
       deploy [options] gitlab <config>
       deploy [options] graph <config>
       deploy [options] deps <config>

  Deploy handles the organization of many build commands for a specific site
  when using the Builder tool.  As usually the Builds require prior loading of
  modules, and builds may be done in different variants, the complete software
  stack becomes difficult to track. Deploy manages a set of defined builds and
  can provide organizational overviews.

Subcommands are

  shell
    print the commands of all builds ordered by their dependencies for
    execution in a shell environment. Typical usage could be `deploy shell
    site.config > buildall.sh && ./buildall.sh`.

  gitlab
    print the build pipeline of all tools in a `.gitlab-ci.yml` includable
    format. The exact necessary syntax depends on the GitLab version, so tuning
    the template may be necessary.

  graph
    Print a DOT graph of the package dependencies to stdout. The resulting
    graph can be converted with Graphviz, for example:
        deploy.py graph site.config | dot -Tx11

Options:
    -v, --verbose       increase output
    -h, --help          print this text
